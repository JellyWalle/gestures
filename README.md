## Introduction
The MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer task lets you recognize hand gestures in real time, and provides the recognized hand gesture results along with the landmarks of the detected hands.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV 
3. MediaPipe 
4. TensorFlow 
5. NumPy

## Installation

Create a new virtual environment with Python version 3 or higher installed. You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Python script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and go to the project directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JellyWalle/gestures.git
```
```bash
cd gestures
```
2. Install the prerequisites as mentioned above.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Python script.
```bash
python run.py
```
4. Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
5. Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to observe real-time recognition.
